First thing's first: change the README file appropriately. Done! Now, we look into creating a downloading script via the Kaggle API. We can only download via the Kaggle CLI, so it's not worth creating a download script. Successfully downloaded the data. This weekend, we need to examine the data: how many numeric fields are there? What kind of data (all money values, or some other kinds of values) and whether any missing fields exist. Specifically:

1. How many numeric fields are there?

2. Is there any missing data (missing fields for any labeled samples)?

Then we can proceed from there.
